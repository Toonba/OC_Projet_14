# OC_Projet_14 : Pass a jQuery library to React

For this project we work for the technology department of a large financial company, WealthHealth.
This company uses an internal web application, called HRnet, which manages employee records. The app is old and uses jQuery on the front end, which leads to massive bugs and increased internal complaints.

The app is composed of one form and one Table, the app also contain 4 jQuery plugin (Date picker, modale, dropdown and dataTable)
Our mission is to convert the whole app into a react app and convert one of this plugin into react plugin and publish it on npm.

In our case we created a date picker plugin.

If you want to take a look here is the [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/toonba-react-date-picker-library) and the [repository](https://github.com/Toonba/toonba-react-date-picker-library)

Other plugin has been coded as react component but havn't been publish as package on npm.

Here is a [preview](https://oc-projet-14.vercel.app/) of the app
